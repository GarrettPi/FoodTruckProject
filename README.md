# Food Trucks

### Overview
Food trucks is a full-featured database application for the entry, manipulation, and retrieval of Food Truck information.     
 The program begins with prompted data entry and proceeds to a menu allowing the user to run several functions on the stored data.
### How to Use

Upon running the program, the user will prompted to enter the following:   

**1** - The name of the food truck to be added to the database   
**2** - The food sold by the food truck   
**3** - The user's numerical rating of the food truck quality on a scale from 1 to 10.

Additionally, the user can enter "quit" as the username to end the data entry and proceed to the menu*      
   
**Entering "quit" before a food truck has been entered will not advance to the menu and will instead terminate the program*

**The Menu**

      
Please Make a Selection:        
1) View all Food Trucks        
2) See Average Food Truck Ratings         
3) See the Highest-Rated Food Truck        
4) Quit the Program
