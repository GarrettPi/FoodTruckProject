# Food Trucks

### Overview
Food trucks is a full-featured database application for the entry, manipulation, and retrieval of Food Truck information.     
 The program begins with prompted data entry and proceeds to a menu allowing the user to run several functions on the stored data.
### How to Use

Upon running the program, the user will prompted to enter the following:   

**1** - The name of the food truck to be added to the database   
**2** - The food sold by the food truck   
**3** - A numerical rating of the food truck quality on a scale from 1 to 10. *    

Additionally, the user can enter "quit" as the username to end the data entry and proceed to the menu *      

*Entering a value less than 1 or greater than 10 will reprompt the user to correct.*        
*Entering "quit" before a food truck has been entered will not advance to the menu and will instead terminate the program*

##### **The Menu**

      
Please Make a Selection:        
1) View all Food Trucks        
2) See Average Food Truck Ratings         
3) See the Highest-Rated Food Truck        
4) Quit the Program        

**Operation**     

The user can select any of the four options and will receive the following outputs:           
**1)** - A list of all food trucks in the database and all the relevant information(**Name, Food Sold, Rating,** and **unique ID number**)       
**2)** - The average rating of all the food trucks in the database                      
**3)** - The highest-rated food truck and all relevant information (**Name, Food Sold, Rating,** and **unique ID number**)      
**4)** - A simple goodbye message followed by program termination

### Lessons Learned

Biggest lesson I learned with this project is that it ALWAYS pays to give your code that one last review.  For instance, I almost left a pair of auto generated static get/set methods for the static truck number field.  Had I done that, I would not have completed the assignment to a sufficient degree to earn full credit.  Thankfully I caught them in time.  It's never too late to double check the plan and make sure your code doesn't deviate.

Another lesson I learned was the true importance of analysis and planning on relation to time management of object-oriented programming projects.  My time was heavily constrained this weekend and that could have impacted my ability to complete the assignment.  Thankfully I spent the requisite time to break down the needs of the program and then plan how best to achieve them.  This allowed me not only to complete the assignment in time, but also to add some quality of life upgrades that make the user experience more reliably enjoyable.
